                    Depending on where you are traveling from, there's a variety of travel 
                    options to our area. There are also a variety of Airbnb hotels and inns 
                    nearby. However, this is a common time for people to travel to New England. 
                    This is the best time to come out in fact, because of the beautiful Fall foliage! 
                    Therefore, it is important to book a good amount in advance because the best 
                    places get taken the fastest. <br /><br/>

                    from our home in Nottingham. It is by far the most convenient to getting to our
                    area, but we have yet to see any direct flights from the Bay Area. It is definitely 
                    worth checking what is available regardless, though you'll likely find much better deals
                    flying into Boston. Since this is a small airport, it is easy to find your way around. </p>

                    and 20 minutes from Nottingham, and there are direct bus lines that travel to our area 
                    (see the public transportation section, the best option being C&J). The airport is easy to 
                    manuever around and the bus lines are right outside the door where you get your luggage.</p>

                    between the Boston airport and Portsmouth, which is a half hour 
                    from Nottingham. There's also a direct line from downtown NYC 
                    (Port Authority) to Portsmouth. There are cheaper buses than C&J around, 
                    but we had taken C&J many times at this point and they have reasonable 
                    rates, are consistently reliable, and their buses are nice (bathrooms, 
                    free water bottles and newspapers, outlets, comfy chairs, etc.).</p>

                    <p className="bus">Amtrak has a station right nearby us, in Durham and Exeter (both NH). 
                    However, there aren't any trains which travel directly from the airport. 
                    If you are comfortable transferring, you could travel from many locations
                    right to Durham or Exeter, which are only around 10-20 minutes away from us. 
                    That being said, I can't make the same comments as C&J for Amtrak in regards 
                    to reliability, though some people have had much better experiences.</p>
